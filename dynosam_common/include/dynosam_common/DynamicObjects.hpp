 * If ^wL_{k-1} is not available in the ObjectPoseMap but  ^w_{k-1}H_K is in the

 * component of ^wL_{k-1} or the ground truth is - if GroundTruthPacketMap is
 * provided, then initalisation with ground truth is preferred.
 *
 * If ^wL_{k-1} and ^w_{k-1}H_K is not available the function will attempt to
 * interpolate between the the last object pose available in the map and the
 * current pose (initalised with object_centroids_k). If the last object pose is
